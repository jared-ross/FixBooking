* FixBooking
A Chrome extension that aims to fix admin.booking.com's session
issues.

Right now it just prevents the invalidation of other tabs you have
open when you log in, and it allows you to manually refresh a stale
session.

It provides a small React/Redux interface injected into the page.

** How it works
This extension only deals with session fixing (for now).
It keeps the bare minimum in state.
*** Foreground (content.js)
- On load, detects the current session, notifies Background.
- Waits for Background session changes, updates in new sessions.
- Can also perform manual session changes, notifies Background.
*** Background (background.js)
- Remembers the last recieved session (the "freshest" session).
- Informs any connected tabs of session changes.

* Running
** Developing
Run both of these:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
npx parcel watch src/js/content.js -d src/build/ -o content.js --hmr-hostname localhost
npx parcel watch src/js/background.js -d src/build/ -o background.js --hmr-hostname localhost
#+END_SRC

Then in Chrome, go to chrome://extensions and click on Load Unpacked
Extension and select this folder.

** Building
Run:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
npm run build
#+END_SRC
