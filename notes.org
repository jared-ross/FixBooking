* Doc
This extension only deals with session fixing (for now).
It keeps the bare minimum in state.
** Foreground (content.js)
- Detects the current session, sends it to background.
- Waits for session changes, updates in new sessions.
- Can also perform manual session changes.
** Background (background.js)
- Remembers the last recieved session (the "freshest" session).
- Informs any connected tabs of session changes.
